## Dplyr Basics

### Overview
[Dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) is a powerful R package within the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), essential for data manipulation. This workshop will help you review `dplyr` verbs that are useful in research and assisting students.

#### How do we specify the function from a specific package?
- Syntax: `packagename::functionname()`

#### What is the difference between a tibble and a data frame?
- **Answer**: Tibbles are designed for large datasets and print only the first few rows and columns that fit on one screen.

### Getting Started with Dplyr
Let's use the `flights` dataset from [Wickham's R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/). This dataset contains all 336,776 flights that departed from NYC in 2013.

```
install.packages("nycflights13")
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
summary(flights)
View(flights)
```

### Dplyr Verbs Overview

```
flights |>
  filter(dest == "IAH") |> 
  group_by(year, month, day) |> 
  summarize(arr_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```

#### Dplyr Verbs are organized into four groups:
1. **Rows**
2. **Columns**
3. **Groups**
4. **Tables**

Note that dplyr verbs can be combined using the powerful pipe operator %>% or |> !!     
The shortcut for the pipe is:
- Mac users: shift + command + m
- windows users: ctrl + shift + m

## Verbs for Rows

### 1. Filter Rows
- `filter()`: Select rows based on conditions without changing their order.
- Find all flights that departed more than four hours late.

```
flights |> filter(dep_delay > 240)
```
Note: filter can be used with combinations of conditions (i.e. Booleans)    
Like == (equal to) != (not equal to)
Common mistakes with filter:    
- using = instead of ==
- any others you can think of?        
### 2. Arrange Rows
- `arrange()`: Adjust the order of rows without changing their content.

```
flights |> arrange(desc(dep_delay))
```

### 3. Unique Rows
- `distinct()`: Find unique rows based on specified columns.

```
flights |> distinct(origin, dest)
```
### 4. Slice Rows
- `slice()`: Select rows by position

```
flights |> slice(1:5)
flights |> slice(seq(1,n(), by=100))
```

### Exercises:
1. **Find flights where `arr_delay` is missing but `dep_delay` is not.**

```
flights |> filter(is.na(arr_delay) & !is.na(dep_delay))
```

2. **How many flights have a missing `dep_time`?**

```
flights |> filter(is.na(dep_time)) |> count()
```

3. **What might these rows represent?**
- Likely flights that were canceled or diverted.

---

## Verbs for Columns

### 1. Select Columns
- `select()`: Choose specific columns.
- Select only the columns related to the origin and destination of flights.

```
flights |> select(origin, dest) |> distinct()
```

### 2. Rename Columns
- `rename()`: Change column names.

```
flights |> rename(dist = distance)
```

### 3. Create New Columns
- `mutate()`: Add or modify columns.
- Create a column showing the difference between scheduled and actual departure times.

```
flights |> mutate(dep_diff = dep_time - sched_dep_time)
```

---

## Verbs for Groups

### 1. Summarize Data by Groups
- `group_by()` and `summarize()`: Group data and generate summary statistics.
- Calculate the average delay by carrier.

```
flights |> group_by(carrier) |> summarize(avg_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```

---

## Additional Exercises

1. **Find the fastest flights to Atlanta.**

```
flights |> filter(dest == "ATL") |> mutate(speed = distance / air_time * 60) |> arrange(desc(speed))
```

2. **Find flights that flew on January 3rd, departed from JFK, and were operated by American Airlines.**



3. **Calculate the percentage of flights that arrived on time or early at JFK.**





## More fun with filter(), mutate(), and more

1. **Dataset Overview: Personal Expenditure 
This dataset includes annual personal expenditures on various categories across five U.S States.**

```
data("USPersonalExpenditure")

```
2. **Explore the data: what year(s) and categories are included?**

```
personal_exp <- as.data.frame(USPersonalExpenditure)

head(personal_exp)

```
3. Next, compute the total expenditure for each category in 1940.
4. Filter data where the 1945 expenditure is above 300, create a new column showing the ratio of 1940-1945 expenditure, and calculate the average ratio. 
5. Group by category, create a column for the percentage change, and summarize the total percentage change across all categories. 


Next, using a dataset either from R or your own, write a script that includes: filter, summarize, and mutate to generate information
about the dataset. We will then take turns showing off our output!
